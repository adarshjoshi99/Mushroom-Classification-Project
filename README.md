# Mushroom-Classification-Project

This dataset includes descriptions of samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

As you know, mushrooms are not just good to taste, but they have some medicinal properties as well. A research centre would like to explore the different types of mushrooms, to understand which of them are edible, and which are not, so that they could discover some of the hidden properties of mushrooms, which could possibly heal certain terminal illnesses.

Using the above information & the dataset, apply the different machine learning techniques to classify if the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
